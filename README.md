# orbitalToolkit

The orbital toolkit is a set of Matlab functions that can be used to model satellite orbits and analyze data

The basic functions are
1. Ingest satellite orbital data: this consists of Two Line Element set (TLE) files and observations of satellites 
2. Propagate satellite orbits: simple Newtonian/Keplerian propagation, common general perturbations (SGP4) as well as hooks to include more complex and accurate methods
3. Compute distances between satellites and predict close approaches
4. Compute schedule of satellite visibilities from ground observers
